Sensirion SEN5x Sensor I²C Python Driver
========================================

This package contains the CircuitPython driver to communicate with the
`Sensirion SEN5x`_ sensors using the I²C interface. It provides a
hardware-independent interface which works with various I²C transceivers.

The driver supports all product variants (SEN50, SEN54, SEN55), but not
all driver features are supported with all product variants. See class
documentation for details which features depend on the product variant.

It is a fork of the official python library provided by Sensirion.
